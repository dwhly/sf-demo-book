Considerations specific to Shuttleworth Foundation Fellows are set out in text-boxes interspersed in the text.&nbsp;</p></div><p class="" style="">This resource is not legal advice. That it is not legal advice should be obvious to you, if it is not then you probably aren't equipped to benefit from this resource or succeed as a social entrepreneur.</p><p>Not everything in this guide will precisely fit your context. There are many legal issues not covered in this resource. Even for issues which are covered there are layers of complexity that cannot be fully set out. After all lawyers spend years going to law school and we like to think we learn something there.</p><p>The specifics of laws differ from one country to the next. This guide mentions specifics but only as examples. Before the Internet only multi-national corporations and international organizations were concerned with working in multiple legal systems. The Internet has changed that. Now social enterprises may be post geographic, with funding from sources in several countries, employees spread across the planet, and volunteers from everywhere.</p><p>If you encounter legal issues that you think will significantly impact your social enterprise then get legal advice.</p><p>This is a resource to help you to identify when you might need legal advise, and to make sense of that advice. Questions are interspersed with simple explanations of the legal issues involved. You might find it useful not just to read this but to write down answers. If there are several people in your enterprise you might consider taking some time just to work through the questions and answers together. Your answers are likely to change as the enterprise develops so it will be useful to re-visit them from time to time.</p><p>This is a work in progress, comment and criticisms are welcome.</p><h1>Thinking about Legal Risk as a Social Entrepreneur&nbsp;</h1><blockquote class="quote" id="72942c31-d4ea-979c-e2b9-00c6aff448ea">when you’re starting something new, everything looks risky...From a 
legal point of view, you’re best to never do anything new. The less new 
things you do, the less likely you are to make a mistake.<br><br>Innovation Killers -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2011/05/25/innovation-killers-the-status-quo-police" class="" title="">The Status Quo Police, Adam Hartung</a></blockquote><blockquote class="quote" id="c42d61ea-8b4b-fa2f-17f7-0538e84c486a">I want a lawyer who advises me not to do something, and when I go ahead and do it anyway will come and bail me out.<br><br>Philip Schmidt, Founder of <a href="http://p2pu.org" class="" title="">P2PU</a></blockquote><p>Legal advice can often become an innovation killer. Legal advisors 
often focus only on one kind of risk; legal risk.  Lawyers sometimes 
fail to consider that an enterprise might fail in its mission, or to 
survive at all, because of self imposed constraints adopted in an effort
 to minimize legal risk. That is not the approach taken here. 
</p><p>Some of the legal risks that social entrepreneurs face are 
incalculable, nobody knows just how likely they are, nor what effect 
that might have on an enterprise. Some risks are reflexive, legal 
development partially depends partially on the entrepreneur's own 
actions. The early manufacturers of cameras simply sold cameras without 
waiting for the law to be settled on whether they would be liable if 
someone took a picture that violated the law. Camera's proved very 
popular so that later on courts refused to impose liability on camera 
manufacturers.
</p><p>Some risks are fairly predictable and there are certain well 
established means for managing these risks. Of course using these risk 
mitigation tools has costs. Important costs are not so much the need to 
pay for legal services which is relatively trivial compared to risks but
 opportunity costs; time and energy spent complying with laws and 
implementing a legal strategy, and distraction or drift from the 
mission.
</p><p>Managing legal risk requires requires a continues process of observation, orientation, decision and action. &nbsp;</p><p></p><figure class="figure" title=""><div class="title"></div><img draggable="false" src="http://wiki.shuttleworthfoundation.org/~shuttlew/wiki/images/1/1e/Boyd_OODAloopscaled2.gif" alt="Complex image about the process of identifying legal risks.

Doing so requires some understanding of the issues. The entrepreneur may decide to do nothing about a particular risk at a particular point in time. That is still an important and useful decision that will serve as a good basis for a future decision when action is necessary.</p><p>A social enterprise should develop a light weight, low maintenance feedback loop to assess legal risk.&nbsp;</p></body>
