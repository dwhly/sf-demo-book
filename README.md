Demo book to see how github-bookeditor works. 

If you want to start your own book, fork [empty-book](http://oerpub.github.io/github-bookeditor/#repo/oerpub/empty-book).

From here you can:

1. **[Read the book online](http://oerpub.github.io/sf-demo-book)** You have two viewer choices. 
  * A simple viewer that will show all books and display math.
  * An epub reader. Note the **TOC button** on the top-left and the **Annotation buttons** on the top-right of the page
2. **[Download the PDF!](http://pdf.oerpub.org/oerpub/sf-demo-book/)** [![PDF Status](http://pdf.oerpub.org/oerpub/sf-demo-book.png)](http://pdf.oerpub.org/oerpub/sf-demo-book/) : updated every time the book is changed
3. **[Edit the Book online!](http://oerpub.github.io/github-bookeditor/#repo/oerpub/sf-demo-book)** : takes a while to load but close the login to just play around
4. [Download the book](https://github.com/oerpub/sf-demo-book/archive/gh-pages.zip) by clicking the "[Download ZIP](https://github.com/oerpub/sf-demo-book/archive/gh-pages.zip)" button on this page
